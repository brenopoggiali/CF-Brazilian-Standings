# CF-World-Standings
Chrome and Firefox extension that filters the standings for a given contest on Codeforces to show only active competitors of a specific country.

All the countries with more than 50 active users are listed and the lists are updated every weekend. Unfortunately, Codeforces does not allow us to have a list with more than 1000 users. In those cases, we give preference for active users (those who played a contest in the last month) and those with higher ratings.
